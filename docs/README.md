## Introduction

_This is an archive of website links, tools and programs that I find useful/interesting._

The concept of this list is inspired by [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) and [useful-tools](https://github.com/trolologuy/useful-tools). 
I wanted to create one that grows accordingly with my experience in Full Stack Development, DevOps, Blockchain, etc.

Please feel free to comment or contribute by openning a pull request if you know better alternatives or if the links are dead.
